# Picus Team Manager

In this task, we ask you to implement a desktop application to manage users and teams in a company.

## Wizard Part

The application should run as a 2-step wizard. When the application starts, user is expected to login in the first wizard page and click `Next`. 
In the next page, users enters his/her purpose logging in so that we can check everyone's purpose on each login and track cause of any unwanted incident.
After clicking the `Next` button, user can access the management system.

## Management Part

There are teams and users in our system. Teams have a unique names and creation dates. Users have name, surname, creation date, phone number and title fields. 
You can add any number of additional fields for internal usage. We can add/remove any number of users and teams.

### Requirements
* We should be able to list teams and users separately.
* We should be able to add users to and remove users from teams. A user can be part of multiple teams.
* In team details, you should list users in the team.
* In user details, you should list all teams of the user.
* If there are users in a team, application should not allow us to delete that team. First, those users should be removed from the team.
* We should be able to query users and teams by their name and creation date range.
* We should be able to query users that belong to a team.

### Bonus features
* There should be pagination in user and team lists.
* To make it similar to our architecture, we expect you to write a simple web server for CRUD operations. Application communicates with this server and the server handles data storage.

## Data management

You need to persist data and relations somewhere (file, database or any other option you prefer) other than memory so that data is preserved upon application exit.

## Development

We do not restricts frameworks or technologies you use. But we prefer you to use WPF-based MVVM architecture for desktop development. 
If you decide to implment a web server, you can use any technology but if you are familiar with Golang, we prefer you to use it. Otherwise you can use .NET as well.

## Submission

Please provide us a Readme to help us execute your application. You can assume we will execute this code on Windows 10. If you need, you can use any free cloud platform to host your server and/or database.

## Evaluation

We will not evaluate this task in a blackbox manner. Therefore, if there are any unclear points to you, you can just write your assumption in a comment and implement accordingly.
